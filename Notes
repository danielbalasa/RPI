Looking arch wiki they mentioned the chipset rtl8811au and they suggest a packet for its drivers.

sudo apt install dkms
git clone https://github.com/zebulon2/rtl8812au.git
cd ./rtl8812au
sudo ./dkms-install.sh 

So fallowing these command you can install the full working driver and get your rtl8811au wifi dongle works without issues !
